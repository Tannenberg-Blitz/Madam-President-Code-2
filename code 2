    "If Cruz wants to talk about elitism, he’s throwing rocks in a glass house. Bring it all up: His wife at Goldman Sachs, his time at Princeton, his work with the NRA, and his FEC violations. Something's gotta stick to him.", // a1
    "Ted Cruz is going to strip women of their bodily autonomy, immigrants of their right to enter this country, and LGBT people of their right to marry.", // a2
    "Attack Cruz’s record. Bring up the shutdown in 2013, bring up all his awful attempts at obstruction. Do Americans really want the man who would shut down the government over the ACA? or do they want a President who gets things done?", // a3
    "Ted Cruz? Is he really going to appeal to the MAGA base? After what Trump said about his family in 2016? Have our surrogates shout it all up on the trail. Hold his feet to the fire on whether he will actually disavow that stain.", // a4
    "For weeks the national airwaves are drowned by the sounds of the attacks from both campaigns on each other's characters. Polls on 538 show two of the most unfavorable candidates of all time as talking heads debate scandal after scandal across the networks.", // q28
    "Election offices report an upsurge in young women Your warnings about Cruz’s radical fight against abortion just might be heard. However, those Republican evangelicals have found their next savior. Megachurch donations flood into Cruz Super PACs.", // Hogan
    "The pundits boil down Cruz’s stance against the ACA to a simple, \"he has clear and solid values\”. A Cruz supporter goes viral claiming America needs to \"drain the swamp\”.",  // Graham
    "Cruz attempts to weave around the question on the trail, trying not to alienate the loyal devotees of Trump.. On the other hand, Trump fires off tweet after tweet that switches between criticizing Canuck Cruz and Crooked Hillary. It will certainly hurt Cruz, but people care less about you than ever.",
    "The Cruz campaign blitzes the swing states from coast to coast, beating on your “woke” agenda and claiming the ‘liberal experiment’ since 2008 is a failure. The rare times he talks about himself range from restricting migration to hollowing the ACA a husk. What do you have to say about his platform?", // q27
    "This is a referendum on Obamacare, and the strides in healthcare made over the last 12 years. Get Barrack and Michelle on the phone, we need them running across the swing states, let them defend their own record here.", // a1
    "Ted Cruz, if elected, would cut taxes for his Billionaire donors. He would sell out the IRS to the highest bidder!  His proposals will be Bush’s tax cuts on steroids, and everyone saw how that went last time.", // a2
    "It’s time to ramp up the attacks on his border policies. This is Trump's rhetoric, and I can shut it down again. Cruz is going to scrap the Dreamer program and build a wall that will bankrupt our nation. If you want true reform on immigration, you can’t trust Ted Cruz.", // a3
    "Cruz is going to destroy years’ worth of diplomacy in the Middle East, whether it be progress against that criminal Assad or the landmark Iranian nuclear deal. Slam him on how he’ll bring us back to the Bush years.", // a4
    "You have to grin and bear it as the Obamas pull crowd after crowd into a liberal frenzy as your legislation is pushed out of the limelight in the heat of the campaign. But if that’s what it takes to win, you’ll push through it.", // q28
    "As professors argue over the true cost of the Cruz agenda, he spouts more idiocy on how he will ‘grow’ America's economy out of this recession. It’s the same old slop, and people drown it out.", // Hogan
    "Whether it’s the cries of \"keep them dreaming” or the growls to \"build that ing wall\”, Americans are more interested than ever in the border. DNC polls show a high likely turnout in the border states, with Latino groups going into overdrive to support you.",  // Graham
    "Appearances by George W. are slowly rolled back by the Cruz campaign, as Haley hits the stump accusing you of coddling Iranian terrorists while Jake Sullivan bravely sticks his head out on 60 Minutes to defend your record.",
    "Cruz fills his rallies with accusations towards you ranging from half-truths to the absurd, weaving tales of your alleged corruption and failure back to your years in Arkansas. Do you try to go high as he goes low or hit back at his claims with brutal force? What accomplishments will you highlight to remind voters of your vision for the future?", // q27
    "We have run one of the most pro environmental administrations in American history whether it be in funding the development of electric cars, Clean jobs or solar panel installations. Let’s hit on our climate credentials with Gore on the trail.", // a1
    "I’m the incumbent in the oval office and it's time to act like it. Let's visit Kenosha, Wisconsin and pay our respects to the deceased. After some of the looting during the summer we need a president to restore calm and order to our streets.", // a2
    "We can’t afford to take the spotlight off Cruz, he’s already gained too much in the polls. Blitz the swing states with another set of ads on Cruz’s time under Bush and his Healthcare policies. We need a knockout blow.", // a3
    "America’s position in the new world order has been secured not only during my time as secretary of state but also as President. Whether it was the Iranian nuclear deal or shoring up NATO in the face of a Russian threat, America under me is standing strong.", // a4
    "It’s remiss of the 90’s as Gore and Bill team up on the trail while a Texan loudmouth talks about Government spending. Regardless in the polls you see a slight uptick in favorability among younger voters but you’re no Sanders or Cortez to them.", // q28
    "Press releases show you shaking hands with Tony Evers and assessing damages as Republican commentators yell of justice for Rittenhouse while the progressives urge you to heed the BLM protests across the networks.", // Hogan
    "Democrats on the fence just can’t feel hopeful in times of Covid and tragedy with their president as she launches another broadside. Polls report that increased amounts of both Democrats and Republicans are deeply unsatisfied with their candidates as the campaigns move into October.",  // Graham
    "Although you can’t travel overseas thanks to covid, your image as a world dealmaker is largely maintained although Cruz along with Bolton and Rubio rip into your stances on Iran and Cuba. This criticism however barely tilts the needle on any major polling.",
    "You step onto the debate stage, facing Cruz as he wears his usual smirk paired with his polished, rehearsed, crowd-tested talking points. How are you going to punch the teeth out of that slime ball's face?", // q27
    "Cruz is a killer, a fighter. I can’t get pulled into a pit I might not be able to brawl in. Deflect and defend my record, and only take a few shots at him when he looks as bad as he is.", // a1
    "This criminal is an out of touch Conservative elitist. His political legacy has been government shutdowns and Dr. Seuss. Don’t forget Obamacare and that fraud he did for his election finances.", // a2
    "We have to show people that Ted Cruz will not be a president for all Americans. He wants to deport the Dreamers, end LGBT marriage and stop abortion practices. Let’s hit on these comments and fire up the base.", // a3
    "Let's play to my strengths and focus on foreign policy. Do you want the woman who negotiated the Iranian nuclear deal representing America or the man who can’t negotiate with his fellow Senators?", // a4
    "They call you meek. Cruz lobs a storm of insults across from his podium, even though you manage to weather the storm. Cruz is the winner, taking his prize through a slight increase in the presidential polls the next day.", // q28
    "The debate devolves into a shouting match, with polls reporting near 50-50 on the winner. However polls over the following days show a majority of Americans feel neither candidate is in touch with the public.", // Hogan
    "Cruz hits back at these claims, forced to play defensive. Polls on CNN and NYT show you as the slight winner of the debate. Your aides at the DNC tell you internal polling is showing greater enthusiasm among core voters.",  // Graham
    "Cruz lashes back with claims of your inability to support Israel and stand up to dictatorships. In the press spin room, John Bolton and Jake Sullivan give interviews across the networks. Most polls show Cruz barely won the debate, but a victory all the same.",

It has to be a mistake, there's no way they're really falling for this establishment sleazebag. How do you plan on getting those numbers back on track to where they should be?", // q27
    "We need to rebuild my female base from 2016. Four years ago, I shattered the hardest and highest glass ceiling in America; we can’t allow Ted Cruz and his GOP minions to glue it back together, stronger than ever.", // a1
    "There must be something on his campaign funding. He’s the candidate of shadowy Republican oligarchs. Let’s see if our sources in the FEC or his campaign can uncover anything incriminating. His campaign’s closet is a cemetery, for god’s sake.", // a2
    "Everything we have on him—we have to use it. The Goldman Sachs links, the FEC violations, anything that makes him look even slimier than he already does. Let’s unleash our Super PACs.", 
    "As always, your impact on women is polarizing. While female TikTokers urge viewers to register for November, Fox News amplifies a Republican voter calling you a \"bitch.\" Meanwhile, Nikki Haley dons an \"I’m with him\" hat onstage at a rally in Pittsburgh.", // q28
    "They strike gold. Millions in undeclared funds are uncovered in Cruz’s campaign budget, forcing him and Nikki Haley to grovel in front of the national press. The momentum tilts back to your campaign as the scandal dominates headlines.", // Hogan

He rambles about the dangers of \"government tyranny\”, delivering some very foreboding lines about \"reforming\” Social Security. He swiftly moves to accuse you of buzzword after buzzword before pandering with his <i>interesting</i> thoughts regarding Cuba. The public is captured by his articulate gibberish, and his polling is starting to climb. How will you stop him, Madam President?", // q27
    "A warmonger. That's all that Rubio is. He is just a crazy man trying his best to look professional while saying that he will bomb everyone in his path. He doesn't think before he talks, he's impulsive, he's not fit for office!", // a1
    "Rubio is a fraud, that's what you all wanted to hear wasn't it? He is a man so accustomed to his chair at the Senate that he completely forgets that the real world has consequences.", // a2

    "Can't they see it? It's Trump's speech all over again! Are they dumb enough to fall for the same failing messaging twice? Of course they are.",
    "Far from being the fluke you expected him to be, Rubio has managed to captivate the electorate with his vague promises of \"a New American Century.\" From Detroit to Phoenix, more and more people gather to listen to his rants about how the country you are leading is a future Venezuela in the making. There's something about him, a certain charm that makes him popular. It could be his youth or just simple Tea Party nostalgia. It's time to bring him back to reality.", // q27
    "This is just another populist attempt to ruin the American economy once and for all. His \"plan\" for the nation is something not seen since the days of Hoover.", // a1
    "How? Well, I don't know how. What I know is that we need to make sure that he is known for the fraud he is. Ads, everywhere. Show his history, make him pay.", // a2
    "This Rubio guy, he doesn't know his stuff. He's just the new wanna-be President with decades old ideas. Sure, he might be drawing crowds everywhere he goes, but so did Trump.", // a3

Nevertheless, voters are buying it, seduced by the siren song of Conservative governance. You need to respond.", // q27

Her RNC acceptance speech harkens back to the playbook of neocon rambling, as she curtly comments on women in the Republican party. She then moves to you. She doesn’t hesitate to point out your vulnerabilities: weak, negligent, bossy.", // q27
    "These Republicans think that the moment you nominate some woman, that suddenly you are the champion of women’s rights. Haley is going to undo everything we have done, because she really is just a puppet of the far-right.", // a1
    "Haley is completely out of touch with the average American. We’ve worked so hard to prevent an escalation in Syria and getting our soldiers out of Afghanistan, and while she’s out there screeching about war, we can focus on real issues.", // a2
    "I made my entire campaign about \"Breaking the glass ceiling”. We can be cordial. Congratulate  Governor Haley on her nomination and pledge to bridge the gender gap in public service. Privately, we will get our surrogates to get vile.", // a3

Her shilling for war, Indian heritage,  lackadaisical and some of them even going so far as to go after her Indian heritage or claiming she is a female Uncle Tom. It’s working.",  // Graham

Oh and before I forget, you no longer have the monopoly on the women’s vote. Sorry, but it looks like you’re going to actually have to try.",
    "Some polls show you trailing Haley. She herself has been travelling the country since 2019, marrying the neo-conservative movement with the tea party-MAGA rhetoric. She will make America respected again globally. She will give money back to the middle class with tax cuts. At least, she says that. You have to fight back.", // q27
    "Haley would send us back to Iraq! I got American troops out of Afghanistan and here comes Haley trying to drag us back. Who would vote for more dead Americans?", // a1
    "The Trump voters are biting their tongue trying not to criticize her. Let’s take initiative on something: Immigration. I promise that in my next term I’ll pass further immigration reform. Something sensible and humane. Then Haley has to really take a look at how much she values her Trump supporters.", // a2

    "The Haley campaign stays silent on the issue, right until Haley tweets about \”hostile aliens\”. Before you know it, she is speaking at a rally in Alabama about a national crisis of illegals sponsored by your administration. A desperate attempt to gain back the voters from last election, which appears to be working. The Trumpists move back to Haley, and \”moderates\” quietly ignore them, just like 2016.", // Hogan

Not to mention her plans to relax the restrictions we have in place to deal with COVID-19, I mean for crying out loud, do I have to remind the Governor that we are currently going through a global pandemic?", // a1
    "I, personally, am very much concerned about how Governor Haley has talked about her vision of foreign policy were she to be elected. I have done all I could to work on a plan to get us out of Afghanistan and planting the seeds that allow us to pursue more open and friendly relations with nations we previously assumed to be opposed to us. Haley on the other hand wants us to get ourselves into a second cold war with Russia or China. Not to mention the increase in military interventions in the Middle East and Asia. Do we really want a return to the Bush era on the international stage? I merely want to keep the peace.", // a2
    "I ask the American people at home watching this: When you look at Governor Haley, do you really see the future President of the United States? I mean, despite how she presents herself as a reasonable but strong conservative, this woman has refused to condemn the radical rhetoric the Republican party had since 2016. Listen to the way she talks about embargoes on China, immigrants, the Mexican border and abortion. All of these are common talking points we saw back when Donald Trump was on the ticket. Have you noticed how the Governor never spoke about any of this until she won the nomination? It won’t be Nikki Haley that becomes the leader of this great nation, it will be the MAGA republicans whispering in her ear.", // a3

And then she has the audacity to say \"We need to actually have an economy to recover after COVID.\” It makes your blood boil.", // q28
    "\"Withdrawing from the world stage isn’t ‘keeping the peace’, Madam President.\” Her voice screeches through your ears. \"And by the way, just because I don’t want this great nation to be pushed around by the Chinese does not mean I want to start a nuclear war, like you have been implying.\”", // Hogan

Sure, a couple of them will probably throw their vote away at the Green Party, but the polls are now predicting a much larger youth voter turnout in your favor come November.", // q28

    "Those Maga supporters, they really hate Hogan. We can emphasize Hogan’s moderation on social issues, while ramping up our visit to traditionally Republican places. We can also moderate a bit, to appeal better to those voters.", // a3

    "Exposing Hogan’s lies about bipartisanship is good, and polls show a drop in Hogan’s favorability, and blunts a lot of Hogan's momentum. Despite the lack of an olive branch, this scares some progressives into voting for you.", // Hogan
    "This shift to the center does not go unnoticed by rural and Southern voters, who are beginning to see you in a new light. Hogan will also have to deal with a larger Maga revolt, however progressives are wary of this strategy.",  // Graham
    "Honesty is not an issue this election, and you are not a good champion of honesty. Furthermore, valuable campaigning resources are wasted in a failed investigation on Hogan.",
    "Both Hogan and Huntsman are viewed as too moderate, and Rino’s by the maga wing of the Republican party. Some are choosing not to vote, or vote for the Libertarians. Donald Trump has chosen to not endorse anyone this campaign, but he is not running for a third party, despite some of his supporters wishes. Hogan promises to support family values, while not elaboration much. How will you treat the Republican division?", // q27
    "Does this really need my comment? Anything I say will likely only motivate Conservatives to vote for Hogan, let's just let this continue without my comment.", // a1
    "Hogan is a popular politician, but you know what’s not popular? The Far-Right wing of the Republican Party. Instead of attacking Hogan on the issues, let’s tie him to the Far-Right. No one wants another Trump, so let’s make the people think Hogan is another Trump.", // a2
    "Jon Huntsman, Hogan’s running mate, said Trump should drop out last election. He also said I was a capable leader, and an impressive public servant. Let’s run ads on that, use his own words against him.", // a3
    "Let’s compare our parties. The Republicans fail to unite behind a single candidate, but the Democratic party is united behind me. How can you trust Hogan to unite the country if he can’t even unite his own party?", // a4
    "No harm, no foul. Trump largely stays out of this campaign, and things largely remain the same between the Maga and Moderate wing of the Republican party.", // q28
    "People find your attacks confusing. Hogan is very Moderate, and didn’t even vote for Trump last election. These attacks also remind the Conservatives how much they hate you, and they reluctantly rally behind Hogan.", // Hogan

    "This works, at first. Once Progressive influencers speak out against your campaign, calling this matchup establishment vs. establishment, voters wonder if the Democrats are united as you say they are.",
    "As this election goes on, unions start to worry about your campaign. Unions were key to winning last election, and their lack of support could be very damaging to your campaign. The Unions won’t support Larry Hogan, with his anti-union policies, but some are on the fence in regards to supporting you. With your presidency being more pro-establishment, and anti-populist than most expected, they are beginning to look into other options, in hopes to make you shift into a more populistic campaign. Unions could be key to winning back the populist vote, or at least some of it, after you abandoned them during your presidency. Will you change your campaigning to appeal to populists and unions?", // q27

    "Hogan’s threat to Moderates is the bigger issue. I'll use my record of bipartisanship, and shift to the center. I'll also expose Hogan’s false claim as a moderate. We’ll need independents to win, and Hogan holds too much influence with them.", // a1

Nobody cares that your accusations are somewhat exaggerated, and Graham himself isn’t eager to denounce his newfound status as a conservative warrior either.", // Hogan
    "If Graham’s even in this position, it’s because people don’t trust you on foreign policy. They’re scared, terrified that you’re embarrassing the country on the world stage, making us look weak and defenseless before Putin and Xi.",  // Graham
    "Caricatures of a red-faced, grunting Graham, hunched over a podium and standing atop a stool quickly make their way all across the net. The bastard tries to hide it, but you know he’s fuming behind closed doors.",
    "Throughout his time in the public eye, Graham has made foreign affairs his main focal point, attaining a record so hawkish it would make a Chicago rioter from 1968 faint on sight. He hasn’t shrunk from it either, calling you \"weak on the world stage\”, and calling for a harsher approach to Russia, China and the Middle East. How will you counter?", // q27
    "He wants to be the foreign policy president? Fine, see how that worked out for Romney eight years ago. While he’s busy pushing for a jihad against Moscow, let’s run around the country and play up our legislative accomplishments.", // a1

    "Graham may get his people, Bush’s people, fired up, but the rest of the country actually learned something from Iraq. They’re not too eager to do that whole thing again, and the senator gets dragged through hell by our brave boys over at the \"lamestream media\”.", // Hogan
    "Graham seems to tone down the attacks, but you acting reckless is only putting you at his level in the public’s eyes. You’re supposed to be a \"mature, intelligent leader”, not whatever the hell the senator is, and this isn’t exactly helping.",  // Graham
    "feedback four (writer forgot this)",
    "As the issue of foreign wars bubbles to the surface, so does that of the people fighting in them. Graham loves to portray himself as a friend of the soldier, displaying a bare minimum amount of compassion on an issue, for a change. How should we push back on this front?", // q27
    "Graham’s record of service is dubious at best. I’ve been seeing some material, talking about how the air force gave him undeserved promotions. Let’s work with that, but try to keep our hands clean, understood?", // a1
    "I can be compassionate too! Show me running around with veterans, but not just that, get me on camera with sick kids in hospitals, women’s associations, whatever you can come up with. By the time I’m done with him, he’ll look like Dick Cheney compared to me.", // a2
    "He puts on a mask of kindness, almost like the recruiters that got those men to where they are in the first place. Graham just wants to make the army seem welcoming, so more people will sign up for his new batch of wars. Keep running with the attacks, and we’ll drown this out.", // a3
    "He’s stuck fixing his approvals? Good, we can barnstorm the country while he’s down. Get Bill and all the other surrogates out, and unleash a wave of ads. By the time the bastard gets back up, we’ll be leading by too much for him to catch up.", // a4
    "Graham refutes the charges in a speech that almost makes him look like an actual person, as fellow Republicans and veterans come out in his defense. Meghan McCain issues an endorsement that the media runs with for a couple days.", // q28
    "Ah yes, because you’re famous for your humanity and down-to-earth demeanor. Get real, nobody’s buying this, and the relentless barrage of mockery you usually endure anyways grows stronger, feeding on the juicy material you’ve just handed it.", // Hogan
    "Despite a slight initial rebound in his approval ratings, little goldfish Graham just can’t swim his way out of the mudslide. As fears of another Iraq are stoked again, many rightfully point out your past record in the senate and that damned vote. Eventually, it all turns into noise, just as planned.",  // Graham
    "With Graham’s vet-friendly persona catching on, SNL airs a skit showing Bill hiding from a recruiter as they attempt to draft him. Under the surface, however, you can feel the push working. While the other guy’s loud and proud, you’re a silent workhorse slowly gaining ground, just like you’ve always been.",

    "Let’s tackle him head on. Talk about how we’re gonna have an Iraq every other week with him in office, about the thousands upon thousands of our boys he’ll send to pointless wars abroad just to stroke his own ego. He can’t get away with it, it would be disastrous.", // a1
    "We need to attack from the rear. Go for his domestic agenda, what little he’s said about it anyways. He’s getting ready to go up there and excoriate me for what’s going on abroad, but we can throw him off balance by simply changing the focus.", // a2
    "What an awful sight. The two potential candidates for the most powerful position in the world, shouting about wars abroad and national security threats for several hours straight. It certainly doesn’t help either of you, as voter motivation seems to crash into the ground on both sides.", // q28
    "Try as you might, people just don’t care that much. Sure, they’re still voting with their pocketbooks, but the main issue this election is the battle against the enemies of the free world, and unless you can argue otherwise, people will simply assume you’re losing it for us.", // Hogan
    "As the day of reckoning approaches, Graham’s media storm seems to get more intense than ever. Spurious claims about America’s position in the world, Fox news hosts slandering your economy, people at Graham’s rallies claiming you support the murder of innocent children. It’s a massive assault, but you need to come out on top.", // q27
    "Make this a partisan fight. Talk about the right to choose, about the moralistic horrors going on in Graham’s home state. Women, queer people, black people, you name it and Graham will become their greatest nightmare. Spread fear, keep our people in line.", // a1
    "We need to fix the optics around my foreign policy. It’s all Graham talks about, so let’s pay a couple visits across the pond, maybe join in some local festivities or whatever. If we change the public’s perception of my diplomatic skills, Graham will have nothing left to hit on.", // a2
    "Graham is nothing but anger. While he’s busy screaming his head off, we’ll show the American people how well my economy has worked out, and how we’ve made the country run better than ever, even in spite of the virus.", 
    "Ah, same-old same-old. Never fails, even if it does rally the other side’s base behind Graham, but it’s not like you were gonna win Mississippi anyways. As the talking heads in the right try to defend themselves from the charges, a flurry of video-essays by college leftists drowns them out within your own support bubble.", // q28
    "Even if you do get some good press, this is a bandaid over a bullet hole. After four years of constant fumbling, people just don’t trust you on the issue, and it’d take a lot more than this to fix that.", // Hogan

Michael Flynn already announced a third-party run. Proceed.", // q27

As the pockets of Republican donors close one by one, the battered turtle drowns in an endless sea of Blue.", // q28
    "Your prognosis was indeed correct. In a cruel irony of fate, his role as the main tormentor of Liberalism is meaningless: the obstructionist-in-chief is completely alien to the values of the people he represents.

    "It was funny at first, but now it's just sad. Wherever he goes, Mitch McConnell is the subject of mockery and scorn. His failed rally in Waukesha speaks for itself. First, his campaign bus was vandalized with far-right memes. Then, Liz Cheney was confronted by Iraq War veterans. It got worse when he got booed by the crowd after calling for \"a decent Republican Party.\" Finally… he just froze in place, with his staff having to remove him from the premises. This last incident has become the highlight of his pathetic campaign. Twist the knife.", // q27

Our 1993 Healthcare plan was ambitious, and it failed back then, but the Democratic party today isn't the same party it was in 1993. With the lessons we've learned, we can finally make it a reality. We need to pass an all-encompassing national health plan that ensures universal health insurance for all Americans.",

The move is received very well by the base and a Gallup poll shows support for a public option at 52%. Your majorities in both chambers allow you to pass it and ignore the Republican whining.",
    "This was a bold move, but it pays off. The promise of Universal Healthcare excites dissatisfied progressives but without scaring moderates thanks to it being less radical in the details compared to Sanders' Medicare for All plan. Republicans line up to oppose you as fiercely as they did in '93, but Democratic majorities in both chambers halt their efforts, and after only a regular and expected amount of political ping-pong, the plan passes through Congress.",

The compromise averts a government shutdown, but the ACA is left bruised, and your credibility falters massively.

            <p style= \"font-size: 97%; font-family:helvetica; margin:0px;\">The mood was cautiously optimistic at the Peninsula hotel suite. There, reclined on her white leather chair, Hillary remained calm, waiting for the fruits of her labor to be validated by the people below her. Four years of clearing the bridge to victory so they could cross on one short night, making the difference between transcendence and failure. Nevertheless, her faith in final victory has never wavered, not even one bit.<br><br>Her team didn't share the same unwavering confidence. James Carville gulped another glass of scotch, grumbling at the sight of the CNN countdown showing when the polls in Florida would close. John Podesta started tapping his fingers repeatedly on the glass table, focusing on the gray-colored televised map of Michigan. Robby Mook anxiously scrolled through Twitter, whispering "Come on" to himself as if his life depended on it. The Three Musketeers, together, maintain the order of the free world.<br><br>And here comes D'Artagnan, in his blue Navy suit, trying to whip his old Southern charm:<br><br>"This one’s nailbiter, huh?" Bill said.<br><br>Hillary turned her head to him, giving him a cold glare, an arrow straight into the First Gentleman's heart.<br><br>"The second time looks harder, but you eventually pull it off. Then you laugh about it later, thinking about why you were so worried in the first place." Bill continued, awkwardly laughing and nodding his head "Hard times always come away. You’ll see." She focused back on the screen without saying anything.<br><br>The CNN coverage panned to the convention center, back to her people. A middle-aged blonde woman proudly waves an "LGBT for Hillary" flag, screaming happily with excitement. A short-haired young trans woman with an Undertale-themed shirt is being brought to tears describing to a reporter how Hillary gave her the bravery she needed to come out to her parents. A 30-year-old White Sociology teacher from Boston describes how the Social Judgment theory explains modern Conservatism. She was their future, their hope for a better world, the only one who understood the stakes. Who would be so cruel, so soulless as to steal their wishes from them? Would voters be willing to abandon them to elect a pompous Texas cowboy with masculinity issues?<br><br>Then, it started to happen. One by one, each blue block began to fall into its correct place. California, New York, Massachusetts. The red ones also started their synchronized dance of decadence. Utah, Alabama, Wyoming. As the electoral college map showed on the screen, Hillary thought it was funny how easily someone could mark the difference between civilization and barbarism just by looking at the colors on the screen. The fence sitters, the doubters, still there, as always. But if they could be persuaded enough, and maybe even taught enough, they could realize she knew what was best for them, like the shepherd guiding the herd.<br><br>And that's exactly what happened: victory. Rewarding hard-earned victory. With the giant geographical puzzle completed, Wolf Blitzer appeared in front of a giant screen with her face plastered all over it, papers in hand, ready to deal the final blow:<br><br>"We can now project the winner of the Presidential race. CNN projects that President Hillary Clinton will be reelected as President of the United States. Despite a tumultuous first term, we can confirm that President Clinton will remain at the White House…"<b><br>A slight smirk appeared on her face when she heard those words. Carville slammed his hands, screaming "Hell yeah!" Podesta grinned and held his fist in the air. Mook sighed, happy his precious numbers were validated. Bill launched a strident laugh from his mouth while uncorking a bottle of Dom Pérignon,<br><br>"Just like we did in '96!"<br><br>"Of course we did." Hillary thought to herself. Why change teams in the middle of the season when you are winning? Only a short-sighted mind would make such a stupid conclusion.<br><br>The call was short, cordial, and to the point, exchanging compliments about unity and working for the good of the nation, congratulating each other for a well-run campaign, and all that garbage that makes the pundits and analysts proud of the democracy they continue to undermine each day. But it wasn't over yet: she needed to see the surrender with her own eyes.<br><br>"Unfortunately, it appears our path to the presidency has been foreclosed."<br><br>Dressed in black, as if he were holding a funeral for his own ego, the sweaty blowhard continued his humiliation.<br><br>"We fought a tough race to put the issues of real America at the forefront. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished."<br><br>Look at him. All that Texas bravado, all that arrogance gone. The chest-thumping rooster became nothing but an unplucked chicken. Pathetic.<br><br>"I congratulated President Clinton and made it clear that I will keep fighting for the right to free speech and religious liberty in our country."<br><br>"What's wrong buddy? Did the feminists steal your balls?" Carville commented with a devilish grin coming from his decayed teeth.<br><br>"The elites might have won this battle, but not the war. Our struggle for freedom continues!"<br><br>"He is done for. If we find someone competent in Texas, he will be in the unemployment line in four years." Mook exclaimed, confidently adjusting his glasses. <br><br>"I have news for the Washington : you won't be able to kill our movement."<br><br>"Looks like we just did that." Podesta sardonically commented, with the rest of the manly choir laughing in response.<br><br>With the ritual of humiliation over and done with, there was nothing left but to reap the rewards. But an oppressive feeling inside her chest remained, an unbearable sensation of emptiness. She could close her eyes and still hear them, drilling her head with their insidious whispers:<br><br>"I don't like Hillary that much, but I voted for her because Cruz sounds so mean and aggressive. Better the devil you know, I guess."<br><br>"I wrote in Bernie in 2016, but Cruz is an Israel shill. I mean, Hillary is too, but she is at least quieter about it."<br><br>"My mother got hit pretty badly by COVID, and we didn't want to lose our insurance. Outside of that, I have no love for her." <br><br>"I'm a Libertarian and gay, but I bit the bullet and voted for Hillary because Cruz is a bigot who hates us. That's it."<br><br>She stood in silence for a few seconds, looking at the starless night on the window. Her ghostly reflection struggled to stare back at her, barely showing half of her face, the rest covered by the bright ceiling lights. No matter how much she gazed at it, she was unable to find the blue of her eyes, replaced by twin dark shadows instead. The hollowness of it…what's the point?<br><br>"Hillary, what's wrong? We won!" Bill said, concerned.<br><br>It didn't matter. Hillary looked at Bill with a bright smile on her face, putting her right arm in the form of an arc.<br><br>"Mr. First Gentleman."<br><br>Bill replied in kind, happily nodding.<br><br>"Madam President"<br><br>Arm in arm, the presidential couple left the suite, heading to the Javits Convention Center. Her roaring mass of supporters was ready to praise their winner, who once again brought them to victory.<br><br>She had everything under control, as always.</p>

But it’s been validated if you look back at the top posts as determined by whatever algorithmic magic Substack uses, which are pretty Graham centric. It was just a truism in 2016 and 2020 that if you wanted to drive traffic on the Internet, you framed the story around Donald Trump. And the recent Republican pick seems to continue that trend.
